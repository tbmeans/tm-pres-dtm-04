The orientation of the planetary orbital planes with respect to the line of sight has not been determined 
observationally.  Therefore we run 60 simulations with likely values for the orbital parameters that determine 
the orientation of the orbital plane, namely, the inclination, and the longitude of ascending node.
a modeling technique known as an N-body fit was applied to generate orbital parameters from the radial velocity
observational data.
