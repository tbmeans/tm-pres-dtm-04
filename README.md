## "Open" presentation
Created in 2004 to present my research as a summer undergraduate intern for
Dept. of Terrestiral Magnetism, Carnegie Institution of Washington. This 
presentation was made in HTML instead of proprietary Microsoft Office
PowerPoint, which was not available on the Unix servers at the academic
institution. I'm not sure if Open Office was available at the time, and
I doubt I had PowerPoint on my personal laptop, but I wanted to upskill
in HTML anyway and have full control over layout.

## Project history
It's unfinished, probably content missing from the HTML written down on an
overhead projector, lol. One page is numbered `0x` because I had not decided
where to place that content in the page sequence.
These HTML slides were originally stored on a Windows XP system in the
following directory, 
`C:\008\Documents and Settings\Desktop\presentation`
and this repo is provided with that structure from the `008` downward,
to preserve things exactly how I wrote them 19 years ago when I was still
learning and HTML was on the 4.01 spec. 

## How to view
Like the majority of my early work, it's intended as HTML to view locally in a
browser, not served over TCP/IP.
Unfortunately, the way I wrote it back then, the href of the image on page 5
is the entire Windows XP path, so just change it to the name of the image as a
reference to the current directory, because if your modern computer is like
mine, Windows 11 denies write permission to your root `C:` even in admin mode
and so you won't be able to just drop the project directory into `C:`.
